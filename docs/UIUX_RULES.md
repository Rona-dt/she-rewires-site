# SHE REWIRES UI/UX Basic Rules (Material You + Brand)

This file is the baseline design standard for all future UI changes.

## 1) Brand and color
- Primary tone: black/white + purple accents.
- Accent colors: `#DEC4FF` (light), `#8A55ED` (main).
- Do not overuse dark purple in large blocks.
- Avoid pure white cards when possible; prefer tonal surfaces.

## 2) Typography
- EN brand name is always: **She Rewires**.
- Bilingual hero rule:
  - EN page: main headline uses "She Rewires".
  - ZH page: top line is "她原力", second line is "She Rewires".

## 3) Components
- Buttons must be pill-shaped (`rounded-full`).
- Cards use generous radii and subtle elevation.
- Inputs follow MD3 filled style (rounded top, emphasized bottom border).

## 4) Motion and interaction
- Use smooth transitions with `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`.
- All clickable elements include tactile press feedback (`active:scale-95`).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 5) Content architecture
- Keep Events and Media content as structured data (not embedded social HTML/iframe).
- Social platforms are linked directly with clear CTA and official icons.
- Global impact content must match official regions/countries exactly.

## 6) Global impact canonical wording
- 3 regions: East Asia, South-East Asia, Europe
- 4 countries: China, Singapore, Germany, UK

## 7) Contact and lead intake
- Default lead intake email: `cobuilder@sherewires.com`
- Contact channels should include WeChat: `TANGTASTIC`
