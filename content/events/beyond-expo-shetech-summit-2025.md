而这一时刻至关重要。

And this moment is crucial.

因为当女性登台时，叙事发生了变化。当年轻女性带头时—整个系统都在演变。因为能见度引发可能性。当女性在科技领域被看见、被听到并被赞美时，它创造了涟漪效应— 解锁了信念、资金、合作和创新，这些可能性可能不会发生。

Because when women take the stage, the narrative changes. When young women lead—the entire system evolves. Because visibility triggers possibility. When women in technology are seen, heard, and celebrated, it creates a ripple effect—unlocking belief, funding, collaboration, and innovation that might not otherwise happen.
